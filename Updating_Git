Create a repo. Make sure there is at least one file in it (even just the README) Generate ssh key:

	ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

Copy the contents of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to your SSH keys in your GitHub account settings. Test SSH key:

	ssh -T git@github.com

clone the repo:
	git clone git://github.com/username/your-repository

Now cd to your git clone folder and do:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git

Now try editing a file (try the README) and then do:
This is the one. Whenver you change a file. Just use the following:
git add -A
git commit -am [Whatever file you're working on]
git push

# YOu can also try:
git status
git commit -m "Latest Update"

# And that should send all your files
# If you need to branch, ie, not work on master
git branch 'name'

# and to work on that branch
git checkout 'name'

# to check which branch you're currently on
git branch

# To push the new branch
git push -u origin 'name'
git branch -a

# When you're done with the branch and want to mege it
git checkout master     # Move back to master
git pull                # Refresh
git branch --merged
git merge 'name'
git push 

# to see any differences in files
git diff

# You can now safetly delete your branch
git branch -d 'name'
git push --delete 'name'
