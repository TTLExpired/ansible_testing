Create a repo. Make sure there is at least one file in it (even just the README) Generate ssh key:

	ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"

Copy the contents of the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to your SSH keys in your GitHub account settings. Test SSH key:

	ssh -T git@github.com

clone the repo:
	git clone git://github.com/username/your-repository

Now cd to your git clone folder and do:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/your-repository.git

git add -A
git commit -am [Whatever file you're working on]
git push

# YOu can also try:
git status
git commit -m "Latest Update"

# And that should send all your files
